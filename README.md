# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



#  Portfolio - Diego Nieves-Alvarado

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio website.  
The site highlights selected projects, technical skills, and experience, with a focus on **front-end development, software engineering fundamentals, and data-oriented thinking**.

---

##  Overview

The portfolio is a single-page React application designed to clearly present:

- Featured projects with live demos and source code
- Technical skill set across front-end, software, and data foundations
- Professional background and focus areas
- Contact and social links

The goal of this site is to provide a **concise, real-world snapshot** of how I design, build, and present production-ready web applications.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite)
- **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **Custom CSS** (no UI framework)
- **Responsive, accessible layout**

---

##  Features

- Full-screen hero section with clear role positioning
- Section-based layout (About, Resume, Projects, Contact)
- Featured project spotlight (CragScore)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Lightweight, fast-loading architecture

---

##  Featured Project

###  CragScore
A React-based web application for discovering and rating indoor climbing gyms using climber-specific criteria.

- Live Demo: *(linked on the portfolio site)*
- Source Code: https://github.com/diegonievesalvarado/cragscore

CragScore demonstrates component-driven UI, state-based filtering, client-side routing, and clean data modeling for front-end systems.

---

##  Running Locally

```bash
- npm install
- npm run dev
- Then open: http://localhost:5173
```
##  Purpose

This portfolio was built to:
- Showcase real-world projects with live demos
- Demonstrate clean front-end architecture
- Highlight engineering decision-making
- Support applications for Front-End Developer, Software Engineer, and Data Engineering roles

---

##  Future Improvements

- Add additional project case studies
- Expand project write-ups with design decisions
- Optional backend integration for dynamic content
